# John’s Professional Services Website

This repository contains the source code for my professional services website.

The site is designed to provide a clear, approachable overview of my services, background, and capabilities, and to make it easy for potential clients to contact me.

## Purpose

This website serves two primary purposes:

1. **Client-facing presence**  
   - Introduces my professional services  
   - Builds trust and familiarity  
   - Provides a simple way for visitors to get in touch  

2. **Demonstration of work**  
   - Showcases the type of clean, practical websites I can build for clients  
   - Demonstrates my approach to structure, clarity, and usability  
   - Acts as a living example of my web development skills  

## Scope

The site is intentionally kept lightweight and focused:
- Clear messaging
- Simple layout
- Fast load times
- Minimal dependencies

This reflects the kind of low-cost, efficient, and maintainable websites I aim to offer to clients.

## Technology

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (light usage where appropriate)
- Git & GitHub for version control

Hosting and deployment details will be added as the project evolves.

## Project Status

This is an active project and will continue to evolve as features are added and the design is refined.
