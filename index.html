            <h2>Flexible help that fits your situation.</h2>
            <p>I offer dependable help with a wide range of tasks—from technical and digital work to general, hands-on assistance.</p>
            <p>Your project might be short-term and practical, or it might be technical and ongoing. What matters most to me is clear communication and expectations, doing the work properly, and leaving people better off when I'm done.</p>
            <p>If what you need doesn't fit neatly into a category, that's okay. You can reach out, describe the situation, and we can decide together whether it makes sense to move forward.</p>
            <p>Examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Technical and digital tasks</li>
                <li>Website setup, updates, or cleanup</li>
                <li>Business and administrative assistance</li>
                <li>Setup and support of business tools and systems</li>
                <li>One-off help or short-term projects</li>
                <li>Practical, local assistance</li>
