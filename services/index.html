            <h1>Working With Me</h1>
            <p>I work with individuals and small businesses who need reliable help with practical, technical, or everyday tasks. Some projects are short-term and hands-on, while others involve systems, organization, or ongoing support.</p>
            <p>I’ve worked across a range of technical, administrative, and hands-on environments, which has made me comfortable stepping into situations that don’t always fit neatly into a single role. Over time, I’ve learned how to listen carefully, ask the right questions, and focus on what will actually make someone’s day or workload easier.</p>
            <p>I try to approach each project with curiosity and respect for the person behind it. Whether someone needs short-term assistance or help setting up something more involved, my goal is to be clear, dependable, and thoughtful throughout the process.</p>
            <h2>What you can expect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A calm, straightforward conversation to start</strong> — you can describe what you need in plain language, and I’ll help translate it into a clear next step.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear expectations</strong> — what we’re doing, what “done” looks like, and what the timeline depends on.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect for your time and situation</strong> — I show up prepared, communicate clearly, and keep things practical.</li>
                <li><strong>Thoughtful, careful work</strong> — I’d rather do something correctly and sustainably than rush through it and leave you with a mess.</li>
                <li><strong>No pressure</strong> — if it’s not a good fit, I’ll tell you honestly and we’ll part on good terms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If this sounds like a good fit for your needs, I’d be glad to hear from you. You can connect with me via the <a href="/contact/">contact page</a> to get in touch.</p>
